# Journey-Of-Ten-Thousand-Steps

This will document my thought process in public. Eventually, I will probably make a blog or an official website about this. 

There are two questions I want to address:
 1. What kind of problems do I want to solve?
 2. What does a super-focused human look like?

And this will document my process for finding the answers to these 2 questions.

## "The road to hell is paved by ten thousand individual steps. But so is the road to heaven.
- Believe in humanity.
- Obey the laws of the world.
- The world as a game.
