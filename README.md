# Journey-Of-Ten-Thousand-Steps

This will document my thought process in public. Eventually, I will probably make a blog or an official website about this. 

There are two questions I want to address:
 1. What kind of problems do I want to solve?
 2. What does a super-focused human look like?

And this will document my process for finding the answers to these 2 questions.

## Principles
- Believe in humanity.
- Obey the laws of the world.
- The world as a game.
- Don't dwell on past mistakes.
- It is humans who choose to believe in God. And that choice has the spark of divinity in it.

## Quotes
- "˹Remember˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive ˹human˺ authority on earth.” They asked ˹Allah˺, “Will You place in it someone who will spread corruption there and shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do not know.”" - Quran 2:30
- "The road to hell is paved by ten thousand individual steps. But so is the road to heaven."
- "We're weak, but by accepting weakness we can build strength." -RPW
- "A snake that does not shed its skin perishes."
