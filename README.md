# Journey-Of-Ten-Thousand-Steps

This will document my thought process in public. Eventually, I will probably make a blog or an official website about this. 

There are two questions I want to address:
 1. What kind of problems do I want to solve?
 2. What does a super-focused human look like?

And this will document my process for finding the answers to these 2 questions.

## Principles
- Believe in humanity.
- Obey the laws of the world.
- The world as a game.
- Don't dwell on past mistakes.
- It is humans who choose to believe in God. And that choice has the spark of divinity in it.
- Praxeology, not truth.
- The power of the peasant, not the child-of-prophecy power.
- A mortal struggling against the infinite.
- I will die one day.
- Everyone will die one day. Earth will no longer be, one day.
- Rejection of blame and praise.
- Arbitrariness, luck. Farce, joke.
- The gift of life is the correlation between actions and fruit.

## Quotes
- "˹Remember˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive ˹human˺ authority on earth.” They asked ˹Allah˺, “Will You place in it someone who will spread corruption there and shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do not know.”" - Quran 2:30
- "Indeed, Allāh will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves." - Quran 13:11
- "Perhaps you dislike something which is good for you and like something which is bad for you. Allah knows and you do not know." - Quran 2:216
- "And Satan will say ˹to his followers˺ after the judgment has been passed, “Indeed, Allah has made you a true promise. I too made you a promise, but I failed you. I did not have any authority over you. I only called you, and you responded to me. So do not blame me; blame yourselves. I cannot save you, nor can you save me. Indeed, I denounce your previous association of me with Allah ˹in loyalty˺. Surely the wrongdoers will suffer a painful punishment.”" - Quran 14:22
- "The road to hell is paved by ten thousand individual steps. But so is the road to heaven."
- "We're weak, but by accepting weakness we can build strength." - RPW
- "A snake that does not shed its skin perishes."
- "If it works, it works." - Millions of programmers, probably
- "All life is problem solving" - Karl Popper
- It is not judgment that we fear, but rather the fact that it is hard to respond.
- "your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." - Matthew 6:10, NIV
- "Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will rule your life and you will call it fate." - NOT Carl Jung, but attributed to him
- A wise man said: “A man with wisdom as soon as adversity appears does that which a
foolish man does after a month (i.e. he resorts to patience).”
- "Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for human masters" - Colossians 3:23

  The ignoble man exercises patience only when he realizes he has no choice. After
wasting a lot of time and energy and panicking and struggling, he realizes that his
impatience will not help him. Then he exercises patience in the same way that a person
who has been tied up to be whipped exercises patience"

  \- Ibn Qayyim, Patience and Gratitude

## Reflections
I am just a mortal, really. That is all I am. Regrets, sadness, pain - all of it will be washed away on the shores of eternity. I am weak, full of flaws and imperfections. And as a simple person without power, I would like to control my mind, and the world.
