# Journey-Of-Ten-Thousand-Steps

This will document my thought process in public. Eventually, I will probably make a blog or an official website about this. 

There are two questions I want to address:
 1. What kind of problems do I want to solve?
 2. What does a super-focused human look like?

And this will document my process for finding the answers to these 2 questions.

## Principles
- Believe in humanity.
- Obey the laws of the world.
- The world as a game.
- Don't dwell on past mistakes.
- It is humans who choose to believe in God. And that choice has the spark of divinity in it.
- Praxeology, not truth.
- The power of the peasant, not the child-of-prophecy power.
- A mortal struggling against the infinite.
- I will die one day.
- Everyone will die one day. Earth will no longer be, one day.
- Rejection of blame and praise.
- Arbitrariness, luck. Farce, joke.

## Quotes
- "˹Remember˺ when your Lord said to the angels, “I am going to place a successive ˹human˺ authority on earth.” They asked ˹Allah˺, “Will You place in it someone who will spread corruption there and shed blood while we glorify Your praises and proclaim Your holiness?” Allah responded, “I know what you do not know.”" - Quran 2:30
- "The road to hell is paved by ten thousand individual steps. But so is the road to heaven."
- "We're weak, but by accepting weakness we can build strength." -RPW
- "A snake that does not shed its skin perishes."
- "If it works, it works." - Millions of programmers, probably
- "Every person has to exercise patience in order to face difficulties, whether he does so
willingly or unwillingly. The noble person exercises patience willingly, because he
realizes the benefits of patience, and he knows that he will be rewarded for his patience
and will be criticized if he panics. He is aware that if he does not have patience,
panicking and impatience will not help him to regain missed opportunities, and will not
take away things he dislikes. Whatever is decreed and is qada’ wa qadr cannot be
prevented from happening, and whatever is decreed not to happen cannot be made to
happen. So an attitude of impatience and panic actually causes harm.
- "All life is problem solving" - Karl Popper
- It is not judgment that we fear, but rather the fact that it is hard to respond.
- "your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven." - Matthew 6:10, NIV

- A wise man said: “A man with wisdom as soon as adversity appears does that which a
foolish man does after a month (i.e. he resorts to patience).”

  The ignoble man exercises patience only when he realizes he has no choice. After
wasting a lot of time and energy and panicking and struggling, he realizes that his
impatience will not help him. Then he exercises patience in the same way that a person
who has been tied up to be whipped exercises patience"

  \- Ibn Qayyim, Patience and Gratitude

## Reflections
I am just a mortal, really. That is all I am. Regrets, sadness, pain - all of it will be washed away on the shores of eternity. I am weak, full of flaws and imperfections. And as a simple person without power, I would like to control my mind, and the world.
